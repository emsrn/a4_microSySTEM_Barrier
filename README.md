## Purpose 

This extension is designed for an educational sliding gate model used in technology lessons. 

It provides simple blocks to: 
* detect obstacle presence with IR and PIR sensors
* read pushed buttons and limit switches modules' states
* turn on/off the IR emitter and LED 
* control the gate's opening and closing
* measure current/voltage using a wattmeter 

### Hardware required 
* BBC micro:bit 
* DFR1216 expansion board
* modules connected to the pins (see product information for wiring diagram)

## API overview 

* `Obstacle detected by IR`
* `Opening/Closing limit switch on`
* `Outside/Inside button pressed`
* `Turn on/off IR emitter`
* `Turn on/off light`
* `Open/Close gate`
* `Motion detected by PIR sensor`
* `Current/Voltage measurement`
* `Display all modules states`

## Example 

```typescript
function open () {
    while (!(a4_Gate.sensorState(LimitSwitch.Opening))) {
        a4_Gate.gate(Gate.CW)
    }
    a4_Gate.gate(Gate.Stop)
}
function close () {
    while (!(a4_Gate.sensorState(LimitSwitch.Closing))) {
        a4_Gate.gate(Gate.CCW)
    }
    a4_Gate.gate(Gate.Stop)
}
basic.forever(function () {
    if (a4_Gate.buttonStateBoolean(ButtonLocation.Ext) || a4_Gate.buttonStateBoolean(ButtonLocation.Int)) {
        open()
        basic.pause(3000)
        close()
    }
})
